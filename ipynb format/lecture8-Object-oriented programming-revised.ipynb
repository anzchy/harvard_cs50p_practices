With `house` as a property, we gain the ability to define how some attribute of our class, `_house`, should be set and retrieved. Indeed, we can now define a function called a “setter”, via `@house.setter`, which will be called whenever the house property is set—for example, with `student.house = \"Gryffindor\"`. Here, we’ve made our setter validate values of `house` for us. Notice how we raise a `ValueError` if the value of `house` is not any of the Harry Potter houses, otherwise, we’ll use `house` to update the value of `_house`. Why `_house` and not `house`? `house` is a property of our class, with functions via which a user attempts to set our class attribute. `_house` is that class attribute itself. The leading underscore, `_`, indicates to users they need not (and indeed, shouldn’t!) modify this value directly. `_house` should *only* be set through the `house` setter. Notice how the `house` property simply returns that value of `_house`, our class attribute that has presumably been validated using our `house` setter.
